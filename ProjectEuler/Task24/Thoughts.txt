Getting all permuations in all orders of 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
Total permuations = 3,628,800 -> 10! 

Heaps algorithm to generate permuations

--Psuedocode

procedure generate(k : integer, A : array of any):
    if k = 1 then
        output(A)
    else
        // Generate permutations with k-th unaltered
        // Initially k = length(A)
        generate(k - 1, A)

        // Generate permutations for k-th swapped with each k-1 initial
        for i := 0; i < k-1; i += 1 do
            // Swap choice dependent on parity of k (even or odd)
            if k is even then
                swap(A[i], A[k-1]) // zero-indexed, the k-th is at k-1
            else
                swap(A[0], A[k-1])
            end if
            generate(k - 1, A)
        end for
    end if

crying. its now working.
he lied. this algorithm DOES NOT WORK! 


algorithm is working. Work on storing all found permutations. 
Error was with swapping position of elements.

New error: when appending a found permutation to "found permutations" array the array is appended incorrectly.
